This package contains a formalisation of a framework 
for modelling, verification and transformation of concurrent 
imperative programs in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover versions 2023, 2022 and 2021-1
(see www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle and LICENSE for more details). 

It includes the following theories:

 - Prelims.thy          -- auxiliaries
 - LA.thy               -- abstract and concrete syntax of the framework's language
 - SmallSteps.thy       -- the computational model
 - Computations.thy     -- potential computations and conditions on these
 - RG.thy               -- the setup of a Hoare-style rely/guarantee (R/G) program logic
 - ProgCorr.thy         -- program correspondences
 - AnnChange.thy        -- annotations do not affect program behaviours 
 - Rules_prelims.thy    -- auxiliaries for Rules.thy
 - Rules.thy            -- rules of the R/G program logic
 - RG_tactics.thy       -- a simple verification conditions generator (VCG) 
                           applying the rules
 - Syntax_examples.thy  -- examples of syntactically correct programs
 - Parallel_Inc.thy     -- the 'parallel increment' example
 - Mutex.thy            -- verification of a model of the Peterson's mutual exclusion algorithm
 
Note: processing Rules.thy may take a few moments.
